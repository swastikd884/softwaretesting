<p> Software Testing plays an important role in Software Development because it can minimize the
 development cost. State-based testing is known as deriving test cases from state machines
 and examining the dynamic behavior of the model. It helps in identifying different faults
 present within a model under the test. Various test cases are being generated from state chart
 diagrams. Unified modeling Language diagrams are used to generate test cases. Generating
 test cases for a machine using UML diagrams comes under the Model-based testing which
 helps in detecting more faster than the code based testing</p>
